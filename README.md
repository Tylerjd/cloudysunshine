An android application that pulls off of r/wallpaper(s) on reddit and displays it as the background

Everyday, while browsing reddit's r/wallpaper and r/wallpapers, I usually come accross one I like a lot, however it becomes
bit of a hassle everyday to have to download it and choose it as a new wallpaper. Not the biggest issue in the world, but I
figure it would be easier to just have an application that does it for you. 

- [ ] Milestone 1: Simple live wallpaper to pull from relevant subreddits
- [ ] Milestone 2: Set how often to pull from subbreddits and update wallpaper
- [ ] Milestone 3: Add or remove subreddits to list of wallpapers to choose from
- [ ] Milestone 4: Custom RSS/Atom feeds?
- [ ] Milestone 5: ??
